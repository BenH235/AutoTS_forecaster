# AutoTS_forecaster

A python library that can automate a number of time series forecasting processes, including:

- Conducting time series cross validation
- Producing evaluation metrics
- Automatic model selection

It also includes the ability to include the impact of public holidays (currently only for daily data) and exogenous variables. If using exogenous variables, it is able to forecast them seperately if the values are not known during the forecasted period.
