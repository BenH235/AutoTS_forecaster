# AutoTS_forecaster

Python library that can automate time series forecasting processes. 

The library can automate a number of steps in the forecasting process, such as:
- Conducting time series cross validation
- Producing evaluation metrics
- Automatic model selection. 

It also includes the ability to include holidays (for daily data) and exogenous variables. If using exogenous variables, it is able to forecast them seperately if the values are not known in the future.
